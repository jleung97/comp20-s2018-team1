COMP 20 Spring 2018 Group 1 Status Report

1. What was accomplished during the week
    Client-side - 
        
    Data Collection & Research - 
        We were able to collect last week's attendance sheet for Ginn and Eaton (partial data).
        
2. What challenges and issues did the team face during the week
    We learned that it would be impossible to update the availabiilty of each building by relying on staff upload, thus we decided that our  website will provide real-time update using a) live IP tracking and b) predictive analysis based on previous staff upload of building availability.
    
3. What are our goals for the next week?
    Server-side -
        start working on creating a database for our project, using MangoDB
    Client-side -
        
    Data Collection & Research
        Continue to collect attendance using staff upload to get a more reliable predictive analysis model. Work on implementing live IP tracking.

* "We learned that it would be impossible to update the availabiilty of each building by relying on staff upload, thus we decided that our website will provide real-time update using a) live IP tracking and b) predictive analysis based on previous staff upload of building availability." => that's a mighty fine explanation and plan to move forward.
* "MangoDB" => LOL!
