COMP 20 Group 1 Status Report 2

(1) what was accomplished during the week
    - create a mongo database for our server and developing a semi-functioning client server (the link to our app is busy-monitor.herokuapp.com). The index page and Dewick page works!
    - formulate a new method of track how many people there are in Tufts locations. After talking to Ming about how to best tackle the project, we decided against using arp-scan or mac-spoofing a router to receive all traffic.

(2) challenges and issues team faced during the week
    - We experienced a lot of challenges and issues this week. We learned that we are unable to follow through with our original plan of using Google's busy times APi to track how many people are in a given location. We did learn how unreliable and problematic it is to rely on packets that others developed. 


(3) your goals for the next week.
    - Create a fake data set and displaying that info
    - Continue to work on making the app fully functional
    - Work with Tufts Dining APi to display today's menu for Dewick and Carm
