COMP 20 Group 1 Status Report 2

(1) what was accomplished during the week
    - create a mongo database for our server and developing a semi-functioning client server (the link to our app is busy-monitor.herokuapp.com). The index page and Dewick page works!
    - formulate a new method of track how many people there are in Tufts locations. After talking to Ming about how to best tackle the project, we decided against our back-up plans which consisted of using arp-scan, mac-spoofing a router to receive all traffic, or sniffing for packets and counting unique ip addresses.

(2) challenges and issues team faced during the week
    - We experienced a lot of challenges and issues this week. We learned that we are unable to follow through with our original plan of using busy times API to track how many people are in a given location. This was due to the npm package potentially violating Google's policies on using their data. This API was not officially part of Google and would scrape data from Google in order to give the client its busy-hours data. However, we did learn how unreliable and problematic it is to rely on packets that others developed.


(3) your goals for the next week.
    - Create a fake data set and displaying that info
    - Continue to work on making the app fully functional
    - Work with Tufts Dining API to display today's menu for Dewick and Carm
